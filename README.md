# Citronix
The Citronix project consists of developing a management application for a lemon farm, allowing farmers to track the production, harvest, and sale of their products. The application facilitates the management of farms, fields, trees, harvests, and sales, while optimizing the monitoring of the productivity of trees according to their age.
